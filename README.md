# Simple r/AskReddit Video Generator
Simple Python program that generates by default 1024x600 videos of a random r/askreddit question and 5 answers. The code is really bad and unorganized so edit the code at your own risk. The program generates images with all the text instead of getting them straight from Reddit because I'm dumb and I don't know how to make website screenshots. You can change the target subreddit to anything though AskReddit is the most optimal one because the program doesn't support images.

# What do I need to run this?
Haven't tested if it works for Windows or Mac so get yourself a Linux machine. You need ffmpeg installed and all the required python modules. Other than that you need wifi that I'm guessing you already have if you're reading this.
